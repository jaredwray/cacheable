# Features
- A simple key/value storage using files to persist the data
- Uses a in-memory cache (via `CacheableMemory`) as the primary storage and then persists the data to disk
- Automatically saves the data to disk via `persistInterval` setting. Off By Default
- Easily Loads the data from disk and into memory with `load` or `loadFile`
- Uses `ttl` and `lruSize` to manage the cache and persist the data
- Only saves the data to disk if the data has changed even when using `persistInterval` or calling `save()`
- Uses `flatted` to parse and stringify the data by default but can be overridden

# Installation
```bash
npm install flat-cache
```

# Getting Started
```javascript
import { FlatCache } from 'flat-cache';
const cache = new FlatCache();
cache.setKey('key', 'value');
cache.save(); // Saves the data to disk
```

lets add it with `ttl`, `lruSize`, and `persistInterval`
```javascript
import { FlatCache } from 'flat-cache';
const cache = new FlatCache({
  ttl: 60 * 60 * 1000 , // 1 hour
  lruSize: 10000, // 10,000 items
  expirationInterval: 5 * 1000 * 60, // 5 minutes
  persistInterval: 5 * 1000 * 60, // 5 minutes
});
cache.setKey('key', 'value');
```

This will save the data to disk every 5 minutes and will remove any data that has not been accessed in 1 hour or if the cache has more than 10,000 items. The `expirationInterval` will check every 5 minutes for expired items and evict them. This is replacement to the `save()` method with a `prune` option as it is no longer needed due to the fact that the in-memory cache handles pruning by `ttl` expiration or `lruSize` which will keep the most recent there.

here is an example doing load from already existing persisted cache

```javascript
import { load } from 'flat-cache';
const cache = load('cache1', './cacheAltDirectory');
```

This will load the cache from the `./cacheAltDirectory` directory with the `cache1` id. If it doesnt exist it will not throw an error but will just return an empty cache.

# Breaking Changes from v5 to v6

There have been many features added and changes made to the `FlatCache` class. Here are the main changes:
- `FlatCache` is now a class and not a function which you can create instances of or using legacy method `load`, `loadFile`, or `create`
- `FlatCache` now uses `CacheableMemory` as the primary storage and then persists the data to disk
- `FlatCache` now uses `ttl` and `lruSize` to manage the cache and persist the data
- `FlatCache` now uses `expirationInterval` to check for expired items in the cache. If it is not set it will do a lazy check on `get` or `getKey`
- `getKey` still exists but is now is an alias to `get` and will be removed in the future
- `setKey` still exists but is now is an alias to `set` and will be removed in the future
- `removeKey` still exists but is now is an alias to `delete` and will be removed in the future

Here is an example of the legacy method `load`:
```javascript
const flatCache = require('flat-cache');
// loads the cache, if one does not exists for the given
// Id a new one will be prepared to be created
const cache = flatCache.load('cacheId');
```

Now you can use the `load` method and ES6 imports:
```javascript
import { FlatCache } from 'flat-cache';
const cache = new FlatCache();
cache.load('cacheId');
```
If you do not specify a `cacheId` it will default to what was set in `FlatCacheOptions` or the default property `cacheId` of `cache1` and default `cacheDir` of `./cache`.

If you want to create a new cache and load from disk if it exists you can use the `create` method:
```javascript
import { create } from 'flat-cache';
const cache = create({ cacheId: 'myCacheId', cacheDir: './mycache', ttl: 60 * 60 * 1000 });
```

# Global Functions

In version 6 we attempted to keep as much as the functionality as possible which includes these functions:

- `create(options?: FlatCacheOptions)` - Creates a new cache and will load the data from disk if it exists
- `createFromFile(filePath, options?: FlatCacheOptions)` - Creates a new cache from a file
- `clearByCacheId(cacheId: string, cacheDir?: string)` - Clears the cache by the cacheId
- `clearAll(cacheDirectory?: string)` - Clears all the caches


# FlatCache Options (FlatCacheOptions)
- `ttl` - The time to live for the cache in milliseconds. Default is `0` which means no expiration
- `lruSize` - The number of items to keep in the cache. Default is `0` which means no limit
- `useClone` - If `true` it will clone the data before returning it. Default is `false`
- `expirationInterval` - The interval to check for expired items in the cache. Default is `0` which means no expiration
- `persistInterval` - The interval to save the data to disk. Default is `0` which means no persistence
- `cacheDir` - The directory to save the cache files. Default is `./cache`
- `cacheId` - The id of the cache. Default is `cache1`

# API

- `cache` - The in-memory cache as a `CacheableMemory` instance
- `cacheDir` - The directory to save the cache files
- `cacheId` - The id of the cache
- `cacheFilePath` - The full path to the cache file
- `cacheDirPath` - The full path to the cache directory
- `persistInterval` - The interval to save the data to disk
- `changesSinceLastSave` - If there have been changes since the last save
- `load(cacheId: string, cacheDir?: string)` - Loads the data from disk
- `loadFile(pathToFile: string)` - Loads the data from disk
- `all()` - Gets all the data in the cache
- `items()` - Gets all the items in the cache
- `keys()` - Gets all the keys in the cache
- `setKey(key: string, value: any, ttl?: string | number)` - (legacy) Sets the key/value pair in the cache
- `set(key: string, value: any, ttl?: string | number)` - Sets the key/value pair in the cache
- `getKey<T>(key: string)` - Gets the value for the key or the default value
- `get<T>(key: string)` - Gets the value for the key or the default value
- `removeKey(key: string)` - Removes the key from the cache
- `delete(key: string)` - Removes the key from the cache
- `clear()` - Clears the cache
- `save(force? boolean)` - Saves the data to disk. If `force` is `true` it will save even if `changesSinceLastSave` is `false`
- `destroy()` - Destroys the cache and remove files
