# Features
- A simple key/value storage using files to persist the data
- Uses a in-memory cache (via `CacheableMemory`) as the primary storage and then persists the data to disk
- Automatically saves the data to disk via `persistInterval` setting. Off By Default
- Easily Loads the data from disk and into memory
- Uses `ttl` and `lruSize` to manage the cache and persist the data
- Only saves the data to disk if the data has changed even when using `persistInterval` or calling `save()`
- Uses `flatted` to parse and stringify the data by default but can be overridden
