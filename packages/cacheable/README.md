`cacheable` is a high performance layer 1 / layer 2 caching engine that is focused on distributed caching with enterprise features such as `CacheSync` (coming soon). It is built on top of the robust storage engine [Keyv](https://keyv.org) and provides a simple API to cache and retrieve data.

* Simple to use with robust API
* Not bloated with additional modules
* Extendable to your own caching engine
* Scalable and trusted storage engine by Keyv
* Memory Caching with LRU and Expiration `CacheableMemory`
* Resilient to failures with try/catch and offline
* Hooks and Events to extend functionality
* Comprehensive testing and code coverage
* Shorthand for ttl in milliseconds `(1m = 60000) (1h = 3600000) (1d = 86400000)`
* Distributed Caching Sync via Pub/Sub (coming soon)
* ESM and CommonJS support with TypeScript
* Maintained and supported regularly

## Getting Started

`cacheable` is primarily used as an extension to you caching engine with a robust storage backend [Keyv](https://keyv.org), Memonization (Wrap), Hooks, Events, and Statistics.

```bash
npm install cacheable
```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';

const cacheable = new Cacheable();
await cacheable.set('key', 'value', 1000);
const value = await cacheable.get('key');
```

This is a basic example where you are only using the in-memory storage engine. To enable layer 1 and layer 2 caching you can use the `secondary` property in the options:

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';
import KeyvRedis from '@keyv/redis';

const secondary = new KeyvRedis('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');
const cache = new Cacheable({secondary});
``` 

In this example, the primary store we will use `lru-cache` and the secondary store is Redis. You can also set multiple stores in the options:

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';
import { Keyv } from 'keyv';
import KeyvRedis from '@keyv/redis';
import { LRUCache } from 'lru-cache'

const primary = new Keyv({store: new LRUCache()});
const secondary = new KeyvRedis('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');
const cache = new Cacheable({primary, secondary});
```

This is a more advanced example and not needed for most use cases.

## Hooks and Events

The following hooks are available for you to extend the functionality of `cacheable` via `CacheableHooks` enum:

* `BEFORE_SET`: This is called before the `set()` method is called.
* `AFTER_SET`: This is called after the `set()` method is called.
* `BEFORE_SET_MANY`: This is called before the `setMany()` method is called.
* `AFTER_SET_MANY`: This is called after the `setMany()` method is called.
* `BEFORE_GET`: This is called before the `get()` method is called.
* `AFTER_GET`: This is called after the `get()` method is called.
* `BEFORE_GET_MANY`: This is called before the `getMany()` method is called.
* `AFTER_GET_MANY`: This is called after the `getMany()` method is called.

An example of how to use these hooks:

```javascript
import { Cacheable, CacheableHooks } from 'cacheable';

const cacheable = new Cacheable();
cacheable.onHook(CacheableHooks.BEFORE_SET, (data) => {
  console.log(`before set: ${data.key} ${data.value}`);
});
```

## Storage Tiering and Caching

`cacheable` is built as a layer 1 and layer 2 caching engine by default. The purpose is to have your layer 1 be fast and your layer 2 be more persistent. The primary store is the layer 1 cache and the secondary store is the layer 2 cache. By adding the secondary store you are enabling layer 2 caching. By default the operations are blocking but fault tolerant:

* `Setting Data`: Sets the value in the primary store and then the secondary store.
* `Getting Data`: Gets the value from the primary if the value does not exist it will get it from the secondary store and set it in the primary store.
* `Deleting Data`: Deletes the value from the primary store and secondary store at the same time waiting for both to respond.
* `Clearing Data`: Clears the primary store and secondary store at the same time waiting for both to respond.

# Shorthand for Time to Live (ttl)

By default `Cacheable` and `CacheableMemory` the `ttl` is in milliseconds but you can use shorthand for the time to live. Here are the following shorthand values:

* `ms`: Milliseconds such as (1ms = 1)
* `s`: Seconds such as (1s = 1000)
* `m`: Minutes such as (1m = 60000)
* `h` or `hr`: Hours such as (1h = 3600000)
* `d`: Days such as (1d = 86400000)

Here is an example of how to use the shorthand for the `ttl`:

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';
const cache = new Cacheable({ ttl: '15m' }); //sets the default ttl to 15 minutes (900000 ms)
cache.set('key', 'value', '1h'); //sets the ttl to 1 hour (3600000 ms) and overrides the default
```

if you want to disable the `ttl` you can set it to `0` or `undefined`:

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';
const cache = new Cacheable({ ttl: 0 }); //sets the default ttl to 0 which is disabled
cache.set('key', 'value', 0); //sets the ttl to 0 which is disabled
```

If you set the ttl to anything below `0` or `undefined` it will disable the ttl for the cache and the value that returns will be `undefined`. With no ttl set the value will be stored `indefinitely`.

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';
const cache = new Cacheable({ ttl: 0 }); //sets the default ttl to 0 which is disabled
console.log(cache.ttl); // undefined
cache.ttl = '1h'; // sets the default ttl to 1 hour (3600000 ms)
console.log(cache.ttl); // '1h'
cache.ttl = -1; // sets the default ttl to 0 which is disabled
console.log(cache.ttl); // undefined
```

## Non-Blocking Operations

If you want your layer 2 (secondary) store to be non-blocking you can set the `nonBlocking` property to `true` in the options. This will make the secondary store non-blocking and will not wait for the secondary store to respond on `setting data`, `deleting data`, or `clearing data`. This is useful if you want to have a faster response time and not wait for the secondary store to respond.

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';
import {KeyvRedis} from '@keyv/redis';

const secondary = new KeyvRedis('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');
const cache = new Cacheable({secondary, nonBlocking: true});
```

## CacheSync - Distributed Updates

`cacheable` has a feature called `CacheSync` that is coming soon. This feature will allow you to have distributed caching with Pub/Sub. This will allow you to have multiple instances of `cacheable` running and when a value is set, deleted, or cleared it will update all instances of `cacheable` with the same value. Current plan is to support the following:

* [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs)
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com)
* [Nats](https://nats.io)
* [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus)
* [Redis Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub)

This feature should be live by end of year. 

## Cacheable Options

The following options are available for you to configure `cacheable`:

* `primary`: The primary store for the cache (layer 1) defaults to in-memory by Keyv.
* `secondary`: The secondary store for the cache (layer 2) usually a persistent cache by Keyv.
* `nonBlocking`: If the secondary store is non-blocking. Default is `false`.
* `stats`: To enable statistics for this instance. Default is `false`.
* `ttl`: The default time to live for the cache in milliseconds. Default is `undefined` which is disabled.

## Cacheable Statistics (Instance Only)

If you want to enable statistics for your instance you can set the `.stats.enabled` property to `true` in the options. This will enable statistics for your instance and you can get the statistics by calling the `stats` property. Here are the following property statistics:

* `hits`: The number of hits in the cache.
* `misses`: The number of misses in the cache.
* `sets`: The number of sets in the cache.
* `deletes`: The number of deletes in the cache.
* `clears`: The number of clears in the cache.
* `errors`: The number of errors in the cache.
* `count`: The number of keys in the cache.
* `vsize`: The estimated byte size of the values in the cache.
* `ksize`: The estimated byte size of the keys in the cache.

You can clear / reset the stats by calling the `.stats.reset()` method.

_This does not enable statistics for your layer 2 cache as that is a distributed cache_.

## CacheableMemory - In-Memory Cache

`cacheable` comes with a built-in in-memory cache called `CacheableMemory`. This is a simple in-memory cache that is used as the primary store for `cacheable`. You can use this as a standalone cache or as a primary store for `cacheable`. Here is an example of how to use `CacheableMemory`:

```javascript
import { CacheableMemory } from 'cacheable';
const options = {
  ttl: '1h', // 1 hour
  useClones: true, // use clones for the values (default is true)
  lruSize: 1000, // the size of the LRU cache (default is 0 which is unlimited)
}
const cache = new CacheableMemory(options);
cache.set('key', 'value');
const value = cache.get('key'); // value
```

You can use `CacheableMemory` as a standalone cache or as a primary store for `cacheable`. You can also set the `useClones` property to `false` if you want to use the same reference for the values. This is useful if you are using large objects and want to save memory. The `lruSize` property is the size of the LRU cache and is set to `0` by default which is unlimited. When setting the `lruSize` property it will limit the number of keys in the cache.

This simple in-memory cache uses multiple Map objects and a with `expiration` and `lru` policies if set to manage the in memory cache at scale.

By default we use lazy expiration deletion which means on `get` and `getMany` type functions we look if it is expired and then delete it. If you want to have a more aggressive expiration policy you can set the `checkInterval` property to a value greater than `0` which will check for expired keys at the interval you set.

### CacheableMemory Options

* `ttl`: The time to live for the cache in milliseconds. Default is `undefined` which is means indefinitely.
* `useClones`: If the cache should use clones for the values. Default is `true`.
* `lruSize`: The size of the LRU cache. Default is `0` which is unlimited.
* `checkInterval`: The interval to check for expired keys in milliseconds. Default is `0` which is disabled.

### CacheableMemory API

* `set(key, value, ttl?)`: Sets a value in the cache.
* `setMany([{key, value, ttl?}])`: Sets multiple values in the cache from `CachableItem`.
* `get(key)`: Gets a value from the cache.
* `getMany([keys])`: Gets multiple values from the cache.
* `getRaw(key)`: Gets a value from the cache as `CacheableStoreItem`.
* `getManyRaw([keys])`: Gets multiple values from the cache as `CacheableStoreItem`.
* `has(key)`: Checks if a value exists in the cache.
* `delete(key)`: Deletes a value from the cache.
* `deleteMany([keys])`: Deletes multiple values from the cache.
* `take(key)`: Takes a value from the cache and deletes it.
* `takeMany([keys])`: Takes multiple values from the cache and deletes them.
* `wrap(function, WrapSyncOptions)`: Wraps a `sync` function in a cache.
* `clear()`: Clears the cache.
* `size()`: The number of keys in the cache.
* `keys()`: The keys in the cache.
* `items()`: The items in the cache as `CacheableStoreItem` example `{ key, value, expires? }`.
* `checkExpired()`: Checks for expired keys in the cache. This is used by the `checkInterval` property.
* `startIntervalCheck()`: Starts the interval check for expired keys if `checkInterval` is above 0 ms.
* `stopIntervalCheck()`: Stops the interval check for expired keys.
* `hash(object: any, algorithm = 'sha256'): string`: Hashes an object with the algorithm. Default is `sha256`.

## Wrap / Memoization for Sync and Async Functions

`Cacheable` and `CacheableMemory` has a feature called `wrap` that allows you to wrap a function in a cache. This is useful for memoization and caching the results of a function. You can wrap a `sync` or `async` function in a cache. Here is an example of how to use the `wrap` function:

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';
const asyncFunction = async (value: number) => {
  return value * 2;
};

const cache = new Cacheable();
const wrappedFunction = cache.wrap(asyncFunction, { ttl: '1h' });
```

In this example we are wrapping an `async` function in a cache with a `ttl` of `1 hour`. This will cache the result of the function for `1 hour` and then expire the value. You can also wrap a `sync` function in a cache:

```javascript
import { CacheableMemory } from 'cacheable';
const syncFunction = (value: number) => {
  return value * 2;
};

const cache = new CacheableMemory();
const wrappedFunction = cache.wrap(syncFunction, { ttl: '1h' });
```

In this example we are wrapping a `sync` function in a cache with a `ttl` of `1 hour`. This will cache the result of the function for `1 hour` and then expire the value.
