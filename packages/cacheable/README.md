`cacheable` is a simple caching engine that uses [Keyv](https://keyv.org) as the storage engine. It is designed to be simple to use and extend. Here are some of the features:

* Simple to use with robust API
* Not bloated with additional modules
* Extendable to your own caching engine
* Scalable and trusted storage engine by Keyv
* Resilient to failures with try/catch
* Hooks and Events to extend functionality
* Comprehensive testing and code coverage
* Tiered Caching with BASE and ACID modes
* Maintained and supported

## Getting Started

`cacheable` is primarily used as an extension to you caching engine with a robust storage backend [Keyv](https://keyv.org), Memonization, Hooks, Events, and Statistics.

```bash
npm install cacheable
```

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';

const cacheable = new Cacheable();
cacheable.set('key', 'value', 1000);
const value = cacheable.get('key');
```

## Extending Your own Caching Engine

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';

export class MyCache extends Cacheable {
  constructor() {
	super();
  }
}
```

From here you now how the ability to use the `cacheable` API. You can also extend the API to add your own functionality.

## Storage Adapters and Keyv

To set Keyv as the storage engine, you can do the following:

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';
import Keyv from 'keyv';

export class MyCache extends Cacheable {
  constructor() {
  options = {
    stores: [new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379')]
  };
	super(new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379'));
  }
}
```

or you can do it at the property level:

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';
import Keyv from 'keyv';

export class MyCache extends Cacheable {
  constructor() {
	super();

	this.stores[0] = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379'); //set redis instead of in-memory
  }
}
```

## Hooks and Events

The following hooks are available for you to extend the functionality of `cacheable` via `CacheableHooks` enum:

* `BEFORE_SET`: This is called before the `set()` method is called.
* `AFTER_SET`: This is called after the `set()` method is called.
* `BEFORE_SET_MANY`: This is called before the `setMany()` method is called.
* `AFTER_SET_MANY`: This is called after the `setMany()` method is called.
* `BEFORE_GET`: This is called before the `get()` method is called.
* `AFTER_GET`: This is called after the `get()` method is called.
* `BEFORE_GET_MANY`: This is called before the `getMany()` method is called.
* `AFTER_GET_MANY`: This is called after the `getMany()` method is called.

An example of how to use these hooks:

```javascript
import { Cacheable, CacheableHooks } from 'cacheable';

const cacheable = new Cacheable();
cacheable.onHook(CacheableHooks.BEFORE_SET, (data) => {
  console.log(`before set: ${data.key} ${data.value}`);
});
```

## Storage Tiering

`cacheable` supports storage tiering with modes for Read and Write. By default the modes are set to the following:

* `CacheWriteMode.BASE`
* `CacheReadMode.FAST_FAILOVER`

You can read more about these modes below. Here is an example of how to use storage tiering:

```javascript
import { Cacheable } from 'cacheable';
import Keyv from 'keyv';
import KeyvRedis from '@keyv/redis';

const cacheOptions = {
  stores: [
    new Keyv(), // in-memory as primary
    new Keyv(KeyvRedis('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379'))
  ]
};

const cache = new Cacheable(cacheOptions);

cache.set('key', 'value', 1000);
const value = cache.get('key');
```

In this scenario the primary store in in-memory and the secondary store is Redis. The primary store is used for all `set()` and `get()` operations. By default the CacheWriteMode is `BASE` and the CacheReadMode is `FAST_FAILOVER`. You can change these modes by setting the `CacheableOptions` or the `.cacheReadMode` and `.cacheWriteMode` properties. Lets go through the modes:

### CacheWriteMode
* `BASE`: This is the default mode. This stands for `Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency`. It will write to the primary store and then attempted to write to all other stores. If the write fails to any store, it will not throw an error. (This is the fastest mode but the least resilient)
* `ACID`: This will write to all stores and if any write fails, it will throw an error. (This is the slowest mode but the most resilient)

### CacheReadMode
* `ASCENDING_COALESCE`: It will read from the primary store and then attempt to read from all other stores until it either runs out of stores or finds a value. If it finds a value it will attempt to set it on the other stores that did not have it. (this is the slowest mode but the most resilient)
* `PRIMARY_RESPONSE`: This will read from the primary store and then return the first value it finds. (This is the fastest mode but the least resilient)
* `FAST_FAILOVER`: This is the default mode. This is like `ASCENDING_COALESCE` but will stop after the second store. (This is the middle ground between speed and resiliency)

## API

* `set(key, value, ttl? | [{string, string, ttl?}])`: Sets a value in the cache.
* `setMany([{key, value, ttl?}])`: Sets multiple values in the cache.
* `get(key)`: Gets a value from the cache.
* `has(key | [key])`: Checks if a value exists in the cache.
* `hasMany([keys])`: Checks if multiple values exist in the cache.
* `getMany([keys])`: Gets multiple values from the cache.
* `delete(key | [key])`: Deletes a value from the cache.
* `clear()`: Clears the cache stores.
* `wrap(function, options)`: Wraps a function in a cache.
* `disconnect()`: Disconnects from the cache stores.
* `onHook(hook, callback)`: Sets a hook.
* `removeHook(hook)`: Removes a hook.
* `on(event, callback)`: Listens for an event.
* `removeListener(event, callback)`: Removes a listener.
* `stores`: Array of Keyv stores. The top store is the primary store.
